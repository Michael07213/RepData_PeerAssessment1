## Loading and preprocessing the data


```r
library(dplyr)
```

```
## 
## Attaching package: 'dplyr'
```

```
## The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
## 
##     filter, lag
```

```
## The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
## 
##     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union
```

```r
# Unzip and read the CSV file
unzip("activity.zip")
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")

# Convert 'date' column to Date type
activity$date <- as.Date(activity$date)

# Preview the dataset
head(activity)
```

```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?


```r

## What is the average daily activity pattern?


```r

## Imputing missing values

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?


```r

# Average steps per interval by day type
avg_by_daytype <- activity_filled %>%
  group_by(interval, day_type) %>%

# Load lattice and plot
library(lattice)
